We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary*months  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings
for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as 
the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

query:
select months*salary as e,count(*) from employee group by e order by e desc limit 1;
