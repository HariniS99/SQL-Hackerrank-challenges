Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


Query:

select case  
    when a+b<=c or a+c<=b or b+c<=a then "Not A Triangle"
    when a=b and b=c then "Equilateral"
    when a=b or a=c or b=c then "Isosceles"
    else "Scalene"
    end 
    from triangles;
